A demonstration of secure agent-to-agent commerce using the Agent Commerce Kit (ACK), showcasing how autonomous AI agents can negotiate and execute USDC to ETH swaps with built-in authentication and payment processing.

This demo showcases agent-to-agent communication using the ACK Hub SDK. It 
demonstrates how AI agents collaborate to execute cryptocurrency swaps, with 
one agent (Agent A) representing a user who wants to swap USDC for ETH, and 
another agent (Agent B) providing the swap service.


## 🌟 About Agent Commerce Kit (ACK)

**Agent Commerce Kit (ACK)** is a set of open-source patterns built by [Catena Labs](https://www.catenalabs.com) to enable AI agents to participate securely in commerce. As we advance toward an AI-native financial future, ACK addresses the fundamental challenge that today's financial infrastructure was not designed for intelligent machines.

### The Vision

Rapid advancements in AI are creating a new "agent economy" where autonomous agents can become powerful economic participants. However, existing financial systems present significant barriers:

- **Identity Crisis**: No widely adopted standards for identifying and authorizing AI agents
- **Transaction Barriers**: Legacy systems impose friction incompatible with autonomous, high-speed agent workflows
- **Untapped Economic Potential**: Current systems cannot support novel transaction models like micropayments for data or direct agent-to-agent payments

ACK solves these challenges through two complementary protocols:
- **ACK-ID**: Verifiable agent identity through DIDs and Verifiable Credentials
- **ACK-Pay**: Agent-native payment patterns for seamless transactions

## 🚀 Getting Started with ACK-Lab

**ACK-Lab** ([ack-lab.catenalabs.com](https://ack-lab.catenalabs.com)) is the trust and control plane for agents - a developer preview platform where you can leverage ACK implementations to give your agents:

1. **An Identity**: A verifiable, cryptographic ID so your agent can prove who it is
2. **A Wallet**: A secure wallet so your agent can pay and get paid
3. **A Rulebook**: Policies that govern what your agent is allowed to do

### Prerequisites

To run this demo, you need to:

1. **Sign up for ACK-Lab Developer Preview** at [ack-lab.catenalabs.com](https://ack-lab.catenalabs.com)
2. **Register your agents** in the ACK-Lab app to obtain credentials
3. **Get an Anthropic API key** from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

Once you have registered two agents (one for the user, one for the swap service), you'll receive CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET credentials for each agent to use with the SDK.

On Replit, click "Run" at the top of your screen to get started.

## 🔐 Agent Commerce Kit Integration

This demo leverages the **Agent Commerce Kit (ACK)** to enable secure, robust transactions between autonomous agents. ACK provides enterprise-grade infrastructure for agent commerce through two core components:

### ACK-ID (Identity & Authentication)
- **Secure Agent Identity**: Each agent receives unique credentials (CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET) that serve as their digital identity
- **Credential Management**: Handles authentication tokens and secure credential exchange between agents
- **Trust Framework**: Ensures only authorized agents can participate in transactions

### ACK-Pay (Payment Processing)
- **Secure Transactions**: Processes payments between agents with built-in security and compliance
- **Payment Tokens**: Generates cryptographically secure payment tokens for transaction authorization
- **Settlement**: Handles the financial settlement between agent wallets

### ack-lab SDK
The `@ack-hub/sdk` npm package abstracts the complexity of credential exchange and payment processing, providing:
- **Simple API Interface**: Clean methods for agent authentication and payment operations
- **Built-in Security**: Automatic handling of JWT tokens, signatures, and encryption
- **Agent Communication**: `createAgentCaller()` method for establishing secure agent-to-agent connections
- **Transaction Safety**: Ensures atomicity and reliability of financial operations

## 🏗️ Architecture & Agent Communication

### Agent Server Architecture

The demo spins up two independent agent servers that communicate via HTTP endpoints:

```
                                          ┌─────────────────┐
                                          │  Pyth Network   │
                                          │ (Price Oracle)  │
                                          │ • ETH/USD rates │
                                          └────────┬────────┘
                                                   │
┌─────────────────┐                      ┌────────▼────────┐
│   Agent A       │  HTTP POST /chat     │   Agent B       │
│    (User)       │─────────────────────▶│ (Swap Service)  │
│  Port: 7576     │◀─────────────────────│  Port: 7577     │
└─────────────────┘  Negotiation Flow    └─────────────────┘
        │                                          │
        └──────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                           │
                    ACK Lab SDK
                 (api.ack-lab.com)
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              │ • Identity Verification  │
              │ • Payment Processing     │
              │ • Token Generation       │
              └─────────────────────────┘
```

### How Agents Communicate

1. **Agent Initialization**: Each agent is instantiated with ACK Lab SDK credentials:
   ```typescript
   const agentASdk = new AckLabSdk({
     baseUrl: "https://api.ack-lab.com",
     clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID_AGENT_A,
     clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET_AGENT_A
   })
   ```

2. **Secure Connection**: Agent A creates a secure caller to Agent B's `/chat` endpoint:
   ```typescript
   const callAgent = agentASdk.createAgentCaller("http://localhost:7577/chat")
   ```

3. **Message Exchange**: Agents communicate through structured HTTP requests to `/chat` endpoints, with the SDK handling:
   - Authentication
   - Request signing
   - Token validation
   - Response verification

4. **Payment Flow**: When agents agree on a swap:
   - Agent B fetches real-time ETH/USD price from Pyth Network
   - Agent B generates a payment token via ACK-Pay
   - Agent A validates and processes the payment
   - Agent B executes the swap and sends ETH upon payment confirmation

## 📊 Demo Scenario

The demo simulates a cryptocurrency swap service where:

### Agent A (User)
- Represents a user wanting to swap USDC for ETH
- Manages wallet address (0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f)
- Executes payments using ACK-Pay
- Confirms transaction receipts

### Agent B (Swap Service)
- Fetches real-time ETH/USD prices from Pyth Network
- Creates payment requests for exact USDC amounts
- Simulates DEX swap execution
- Sends ETH to user's wallet upon payment confirmation

### Price Oracle Integration
- **Pyth Network**: Provides real-time ETH/USD price feeds
- **Price Updates**: Fetched on-demand for each swap request
- **Confidence Intervals**: Displays price confidence data
- **Fallback Pricing**: Uses $3500 if oracle is unavailable

## 🔑 Security Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All agent communications are secured
- **Token-Based Auth**: JWT tokens for session management
- **Credential Isolation**: Each agent has separate credentials
- **Payment Security**: ACK-Pay ensures secure financial transactions
- **Price Oracle Verification**: Real-time price data from trusted source

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Agent Configuration
```typescript
// Agent B with payment capabilities and price oracle
const pythClient = new HermesClient("https://hermes.pyth.network", {})
const agentBSdk = new AckLabSdk({
  baseUrl: "https://api.ack-lab.com",
  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID_AGENT_B,
  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET_AGENT_B
})

// Serve authenticated agent with SDK
serveAuthedAgent({
  port: 7577,
  runAgent: runAgentB,
  sdk: agentBSdk
})
```

### Communication Protocol
- **Request**: JSON payload with swap instructions
- **Processing**: AI model generates contextual responses
- **Tools**: Agents use function calling for payments and swaps
- **Response**: Structured JSON with transaction details

### Swap Execution Flow
1. **Rate Discovery**: Fetch current ETH/USD from Pyth Network
2. **Payment Request**: Generate JWT token with swap details
3. **Payment Processing**: Execute USDC payment via ACK-Pay
4. **Swap Simulation**: Process swap on mock DEX
5. **ETH Delivery**: Transfer ETH to user's wallet
6. **Confirmation**: Return transaction hashes and receipt

### General Issues
- **Missing credentials**: Ensure all five environment variables are set
- **Connection refused**: Verify agent servers are running on correct ports
- **Payment failures**: Check ACK Lab API connectivity and credentials
- **Price oracle errors**: Verify internet connectivity for Pyth Network access
